This folder contains example plots showing the Gaussian process model.
The "ribbon" plots show the mean (black line), 50% (dark blue) and 95% (light blue) credible intervals from the Gaussian process, with the true observed data plotted in red. Note that the ribbon plots were generated by an earlier iteration of the model that included mean blood pressure. Ribbon plots are all from the MIMIC cohort.
The "cov" plots show the covariance between variables.
The "trace" plots show the output of the MCMC sampling used to fit the Gaussian process.
