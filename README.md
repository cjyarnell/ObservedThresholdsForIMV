Yarnell, Christopher

These folders contain the code and scripts used to generate the cohort and perform the analysis for the Yarnell et al manuscript focused on studying which thresholds for invasive ventilation are used in clinical practice.
The cohort generation code is found in "BigQueryScripts" and "CreateCohortR." 
The multiple imputation and analysis code is found in "MultipleImputation" and "Outcomes".
The analysis was performed on the Compute Canada cluster. The shell scripts to submit the jobs to the slurm scheduler are available on request, just send me an email  christopher.yarnell@mail.utoronto.ca.
